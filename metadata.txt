about=The S+HydPower QGIS Plugin is a powerful tool designed to estimate hydropower generation and evaluate the socioeconomic impact of watershed management measures. It accomplishes this by utilizing hydrological SWAT+ simulated outputs, which serve as the foundation for estimating hydropower generation and the associated impacts. Additionally, the plugin allows users to explore various scenarios based on the functioning and characteristics of the hydropower system. This plugin uses an icon designed by Freepick from flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/hydro-power).
